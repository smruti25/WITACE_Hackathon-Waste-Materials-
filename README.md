#SHORT DESCRIPTION :- 
•	What’s the Problem ?
Today‘s main issue is of garbage thrown by the people. These materials take more than 400 years to decompose so there is extreme need to reduce this waste materials. Current Generating Power Plants burn these materials and emit extreme Air Pollution which can be highly dangerous for our health. Excess amount of harmful gases can lower down the level of Oxygen leading to Lungs Issues. 

•	How can Technology help?
The Heating Panels’ Principle- To generate Electricity. They are attached to Furnace to absorb heat and convert it into electricity with the comprised photovoltaic cells which directly converts heat energy to electrical energy. 
Electrostatic Precipitator- To collect small ash particles. 
Electrolysis Process- To split CO2 in water.
Various water treatment processes.

•	The Idea :
Garbage is burned in the furnace where the heating panels will absorb heat and convert to Electricity and passed on to various loads. The emitted smoke of garbage is exhausted to water tank where electrolysis process will separate CO2 to Carbon and Oxygen where carbon will settle down in water tank and oxygen will be released in air. The carbon water can be supplied to plants which will be useful for them.

•	#LONG DESCRIPTION :-

Economic growth, changing production and consumption patterns are resulting into rapid increase in waste all over the globe. After food and paper waste, plastic waste is the major constitute of municipal and industrial waste in cities. Even the cities with low economic growth have started producing more plastic waste due to plastic packaging, shopping bags, PET bottles and other goods/ appliances using plastic as major component. This waste management and sanitization has turned into a major challenge for all. Due to lack of integrated waste management, most of the plastic waste is neither collected properly nor disposed in appropriate manner avoiding its negative impacts on environment and public health. 

Additionally, most of the Non-Biodegradable materials take more than 400 years to decompose in the land, so there is extreme need to reduce these waste materials. 
Selected garbage is recycled Compost is generated from Organic waste. The Non – Biodegradable materials can be further passed our generating. There these materials will be burned in the furnace. The heating panels attached around to furnace absorb the heat and convert it into Electrical energy which is supplied to various loads. When the garbage is burned in the furnace, the emitted smoke will be exhausted through Electrostatic Precipitator (ESP) in which most of the ash is collected from the smoke and rest is passed through chimney. Further this smoke will be exhausted into water tank, not in the open air through chimney. Most of smoke part contains CO2 which can be dissolved only in acidic water. So to dissolve it in the water PH is lowered approximately to 4.5 PH and made it acidic with sour substances. As the hot smoke is going to be dissolved in water, it is necessary to cool it down continuously transporting through the cooling tower. Further with the electrolysis process, the dissolved CO2 will be partially splitted into C and O2 so the Carbon will settle down in the water tank and the O2 will release in the air. But some of it will be released in the air which can be absorbed by planting oak, teak and neem trees. Due to settling of carbon the water in tank will be polluted which is further purified by using sand and carbon filters to reuse it. This water can be used for drenching to trees planted around the plant. It is time for all cities to pay attention to this source for power as an economical way to tackle the city waste and generate electricity. 

If we not became vigilant today then definitely garbage will take over all of us. Let us not forget that “We are a part of the environment, not apart from the environment.”

•	#PROJECT ROADMAP :

•	Reduces Garbage Pollution
  - Soil Pollution
  - Ground Water Pollution 
  - Soil Fertility Reduction
•	Reduces Air Pollution 
•	Reduces the necessity of Landfills
•	Fulfil the need of Electricity 
•	Increases greenery in Environment 
•	Increases the Level of Oxygen


•	#GETTING STARTED :

The main Instructions for running our project are:
•	Handling the furnace temperature carefully.
•	Handling the electricity distribution carefully.
•	Not working close water due to various gases.

•	#CONCLUSION :
This electricity generating plants is the most efficient to convert to electricity. Our plants reduces the waste volume drastically in most Eco-Friendly manner, at the same time reducing the necessity of landfills. Garbage is very efficiently utilized and much needed electricity is generated, bringing the gap for electricity requirement. 
It is time for all cities to pay attention to this source for power as an economical way to tackle the city waste and generate electricity..
